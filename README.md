# Honours Thesis Project: Circuit Schematic Detection and Conversion

Welcome to the repository for my honours thesis project! If you find this research helpful, please consider starring this repository.

# Project Overview

This project involves detecting components in hand-drawn circuit schematics using the state-of-the-art YOLOv8 object detection model. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the process:

* Component Detection: YOLOv8 detects various components within the circuit schematic.
* Image Processing: Advanced techniques such as Hough Transform, Pixel Density Analysis, and Pixel Tracing are used to determine how the components are connected.
* Netlist Generation: The processed information is used to create a netlist in LT-Spice format, making the schematic ready for simulation.

The system achieves high accuracy in converting schematics, especially for non-terminal components. Graphically terminalled components (like diodes and DC sources) were less accurately identified due to limited training on this subset.

The full system pipeline is depicted graphically below:

The web application is built using Python, Flask, and SQLAlchemy. These technologies support the entire pipeline process, from detection to netlist generation.

# More

Please note that this repository is based on my research conducted at the University of Cape Town. I have included my thesis below for additional detail.

# Installation

This repository is still under construction - not all the training data/labels are present. 
However, the web application should run once requirements are installed. 

Once the requirements are installed, the web application can be run by navigating into the web_app directory and running:

> python3 main.py

Ensure that the process runs on an unused port. Navigate to the terminal-specified page in your favourite browser to access the web application.

Note: This code currently only works on MacOS. A Windows-compatible version may become available in the future.
