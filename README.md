# Hi There!

This repository is still under construction - not all the training data/labels are present. 
However, the web application should run once requirements are installed. 

Once the requirements are installed, the web application can be run by navigating into the web_app directory and running:

> python3 main.py

Ensure that the script listens on an unused port. Navigate to the terminal-specified page in your favourite browser to use.

Note: This code currently only works on MacOS. A Windows-compatible version should be released soon.
